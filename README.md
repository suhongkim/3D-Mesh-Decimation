# 3D Mesh Decimation
Quadric-based Mesh Decimation Via Multiple Choices Algorithm

## Getting Started

Poisson Blending is implemented with sparse matrix to solve the linear equation (Ax=b). It can
handle gray or RGB image by recursive method. 

### Prerequisites



```
MATLAB2018 
```

### Run
Select background and target images in main.m, then execute main.m
Default images in 'image' folder
```
main
```

## Inspiration
This project is a part of the CMPT743 assignments at SFU. My implementation is poisson_blend.m, and others are from the skeleton [code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSOQUHlr4j6_6t22hyBRFSaWaRqseNcs/view).\
